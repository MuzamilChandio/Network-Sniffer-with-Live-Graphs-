🚀 Professional Network Sniffer with Live Graphs | Rhombix Technologies Internship Project

As part of my internship at Rhombix Technologies, I built a Hacker-Style Network Sniffer in Python — a complete tool for real-time packet capture, protocol analysis, and network security insights.

💻 Key Features:
🔹 Targeted sniffing with IP/Domain input & protocol filters (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, DNS, HTTP)
🔹 Live packet capture with timestamped logs
🔹 Built-in Port Scanner (1–1024) to identify open services
🔹 Real-time visual analytics:
 📊 Bar Chart – Protocol usage counts
 📈 Line Chart – Packets per second over time
🔹 Save logs for future analysis
🔹 Start/Stop sniffing instantly without restarting the tool

⚙ Tech Stack:
✅ Python (Core Language)
✅ Scapy – Packet sniffing & protocol parsing
✅ Matplotlib – Real-time data visualization
✅ Tkinter – GUI development
✅ Socket – DNS resolution & port scanning

📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ Enter a target IP/Domain & optional protocol filter
2️⃣ Start sniffing to capture packets in real time
3️⃣ View live logs + dynamic graphs updated every second
4️⃣ Run a quick port scan to detect open services
5️⃣ Save logs for security analysis or reports

🎯 Skills Gained:

Network security & packet-level analysis

Multi-threaded Python GUI design

Real-time data plotting inside Tkinter

Understanding of protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP/ARP/DNS)

Port scanning techniques & network reconnaissance

This project combines cybersecurity, data visualization, and software engineering — making it a practical tool for both learning and real-world analysis.
